Hello, my name is Alex Keyes. I am a developer who likes the internet, hip hop, and a bunch of other stuff.

# What do you do?
I make things. Almost all of the code I write is on my [Github](https://github.com/alex-keyes).

# What programming languages do you use?
When making websites I like using HTML and CSS with a little Javascript but I also like Python and bash and C++ for making not websites.
