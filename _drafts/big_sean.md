big sean is amazing.  I used to think he was concieted and annoying however his message is deeply inspirational.

He puts his family first and the value of work second.  Self love is a huge part of his message.  He goes beyond the misogyny of modern rappers and eloquently articulates
the struggles and successes of his life.  

to quote sean don: looking like we robbed the bank but all we make is deposits
