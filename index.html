    <p>I am a Fullstack Developer at <a href="http://thinkmerlin.com/">Merlin</a></p>

    <p>
      I love interacting with new people, languages and frameworks.
      Software has the power to change the world.  That's what I'm all about.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am currently focused on web development, with most of my time spent writing PHP and Javascript.  I also have a background in
        working on the backend,  writing Python.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're interested in learning more about my background, check out my
      <a href="/portfolio">work</a> to see what I've done and
      what I'm doing right now.  If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to send me an email.
