    <p>
      I love interacting with new people, languages and frameworks.
      Software has the power to change the world.  That's what I'm all about.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now I've been learning about blockchains. This means my focus is security, speed and great programming, using primarily C++ and Python.
      I also love web development, with most of my time spent writing HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
