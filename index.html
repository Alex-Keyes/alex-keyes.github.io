    <p>
      I'm currently the lead software engineer at <a href="http://bayesquare.com/">Bayesquare</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love interacting with new people, languages and frameworks.
      Software has the power to make people more productive and happier. That's what I'm all about.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now I'm particularly interested in the intersection of programming
      and finance.  This means my focus is on machine learning, statistics,
      and manipulating data-sets with Python.
      I also love web development, with most of my time spent writing HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP.  
    </p>
