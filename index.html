        <p>
            I am a software engineer at <a href="http://signafire.com/">Signafire</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            I love interacting with new people, languages and frameworks.
            Software has the power to change the world.  That's what I'm all about.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am currently focused on backend development, with most of my time spent writing Clojure.  I also have a background in
            working on the backend, writing Python and C++ for any kind of algorithm / theory question.
        </p>
