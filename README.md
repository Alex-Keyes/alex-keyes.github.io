My website made with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

If you're interested, clone it and play around locally with Jekyll serve.  

This website is also a work in progress, if you think I can improve it in some way, please check it out and let me know!
